  "content": "It is recommend that you first read the Pixel Perfect Rendering page.\n\nThe following functions can be used to get the calculated width that the library would use for the full width of a bar (data point) at a specific bar spacing and device pixel ratio. This can be used when you would like to use the full width available for each data point on the x axis, and don't want any gaps to be visible.",
