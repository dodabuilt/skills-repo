  "content": "The first thing you need to do to use lightweight-charts is to install it from npm:\n\nNote that the package is shipped with TypeScript declarations, so you can easily use it within TypeScript code.\n\nThe Lightweight Charts™ license requires specifying TradingView as the product creator.\n\nYou shall add the \"attribution notice\" from the NOTICE file and a link to https://www.tradingview.com to the page of your website or mobile application that is available to your users.\n\nAs thanks for creating Lightweight Charts™, we'd be grateful if you add the attribution notice in a prominent place.\n\nOnce the library has been installed in your repo you're ready to create your first chart.\n\nFirst of all, in a file where you would like to create a chart you need to import the library:\n\ncreateChart is the entry-point for creating charts. You can use it to create as many charts as you need:\n\nThe result of this function is a IChartApi object, which you need to use to work with a chart instance.\n\nOnce your chart is created it is ready to display data.\n\nThe basic primitive to display a data is a series. There are different types of series:\n\nTo create a series with desired type you need to use appropriate method from IChartApi. All of them have the same naming add<type>Series, where <type> is a type of a series you'd like to create:\n\nPlease look at this page for more information about different series types.\n\nNote that a series cannot be transferred from one type to another one since different series types have different data and options types.\n\nOnce your chart and series are created it's time to set data to the series.\n\nNote that regardless of the series type, the API calls are the same (the type of the data might be different though).\n\nTo set the data (or to replace all data items) to a series you need to use ISeriesApi.setData method:\n\nIn a case when your data is updated (e.g. real-time updates) you might want to update the chart as well.\n\nBut using ISeriesApi.setData very often might affect the performance and we do not recommend to do this. Also it replaces all series data with the new one, and probably this is not what you're looking for.\n\nThus, to update the data you can use a method ISeriesApi.update. It allows you to update the last data item or add a new one much faster without affecting the performance:",
