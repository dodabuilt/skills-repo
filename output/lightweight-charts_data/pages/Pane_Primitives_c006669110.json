These are essentially the same as Series Primitives but are designed to draw on the pane of a chart rather than being associated with a specific series. Pane Primitives can be used for features like watermarks or other chart-wide annotations. Key Differences from Series Primitives​ Pane Primitives are attached to the chart pane rather than a specific series. They cannot draw on the price and time scales. They are ideal for chart-wide features that are not tied to a particular series. Adding a Pane Primitive​ Pane Primitives can be added to a chart using the attachPrimitive method on the IPaneApi interface. Here's an example: const chart = createChart(document.getElementById('container'));const pane = chart.panes()[0]; // Get the first (main) paneconst myPanePrimitive = new MyCustomPanePrimitive();pane.attachPrimitive(myPanePrimitive); Implementing a Pane Primitive​ To create a Pane Primitive, you should implement the IPanePrimitive interface. This interface is similar to ISeriesPrimitive, but with some key differences: It doesn't include methods for drawing on price and time scales. The paneViews method is used to define what will be drawn on the chart pane. Here's a basic example of a Pane Primitive implementation: class MyCustomPanePrimitive { paneViews() { return [ { renderer: { draw: target => { // Custom drawing logic here }, }, }, ]; } // Other methods as needed...} For more details on implementing Pane Primitives, refer to the IPanePrimitive interface documentation.",
