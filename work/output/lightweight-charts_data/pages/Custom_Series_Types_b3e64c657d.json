  "content": "Custom series allow developers to create new types of series with their own data structures, and rendering logic (implemented using CanvasRenderingContext2D methods). These custom series extend the current capabilities of our built-in series, providing a consistent API which mirrors the built-in chart types.\n\nThese series are expected to have a uniform width for each data point, which ensures that the chart maintains a consistent look and feel across all series types. The only restriction on the data structure is that it should extend the CustomData interface (have a valid time property for each data point).\n\nA custom series should implement the ICustomSeriesPaneView interface. The interface defines the basic functionality and structure required for creating a custom series view.\n\nIt includes the following methods and properties:\n\nThis method should return a renderer which implements the ICustomSeriesPaneRenderer interface and is used to draw the series data on the main chart pane.\n\nThe draw method of the renderer is evoked whenever the chart needs to draw the series.\n\nThe PriceToCoordinateConverter provided as the 2nd argument to the draw method is a convenience function for changing prices into vertical coordinate values. It is provided since the series' original data will most likely be defined in price values, and the renderer needs to draw with coordinates. The values returned by the converter will be defined in mediaSize (unscaled by devicePixelRatio).\n\nCanvasRenderingTarget2D provided within the draw function is explained in more detail on the Canvas Rendering Target page.\n\nThis method will be called with the latest data for the renderer to use during the next paint.\n\nThe update method is evoked with two parameters: data (discussed below), and seriesOptions. seriesOptions is a reference to the currently applied options for the series\n\nThe PaneRendererCustomData interface provides the data that can be used within the renderer for drawing the series data. It includes the following properties:\n\nA function for interpreting the custom series data and returning an array of numbers representing the prices values for the item, specifically the equivalent highest, lowest, and current price values for the data item.\n\nThese price values are used by the chart to determine the auto-scaling (to ensure the items are in view) and the crosshair and price line positions. The largest and smallest values in the array will be used to specify the visible range of the painted item, and the last value will be used for the crosshair and price line position.\n\nA function used by the library to determine which data points provided by the user should be considered Whitespace. The method should return true when the data point is Whitespace. Data points which are whitespace data won't be provided to the renderer, or the priceValueBuilder.\n\nThe default options to be used for the series. The user can override these values using the options argument in addCustomSeries, or via the applyOptions method on the ISeriesAPI.\n\nThis method will be evoked when the series has been removed from the chart. This method should be used to clean up any objects, references, and other items that could potentially cause memory leaks.\n\nThis method should contain all the necessary code to clean up the object before it is removed from memory. This includes removing any event listeners or timers that are attached to the object, removing any references to other objects, and resetting any values or properties that were modified during the lifetime of the object.",
