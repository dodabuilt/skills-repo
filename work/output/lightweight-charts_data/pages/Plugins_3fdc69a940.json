  "content": "Plugins allow you to extend the library's functionality and render custom elements, such as new series, drawing tools, indicators, and watermarks.\n\nYou can create plugins of the following types:\n\nCustom series allow you to define new types of series with custom data structures and rendering logic. For implementation details, refer to the Custom Series Types article.\n\nUse the addCustomSeries method to add a custom series to the chart. Then, you can manage it through the same API available for built-in series. For example, call the setData method to populate the series with data.\n\nPrimitives allow you to define custom visualizations, drawing tools, and chart annotations. You can render them at different levels in the visual stack to create complex, layered compositions.\n\nSeries primitives are attached to a specific series and can render on the main pane, price and time scales. For implementation details, refer to the Series Primitives article.\n\nUse the attachPrimitive method to add a primitive to the chart and attach it to the series.\n\nPane primitives are attached to a chart pane rather than a specific series. You can use them to create chart-wide annotations and features like watermarks. For implementation details, refer to the Pane Primitives article.\n\nNote that pane primitives cannot render on the price or time scale.\n\nUse the attachPrimitive method to add a primitive to the chart and attach it to the pane.",
