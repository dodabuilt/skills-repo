Despite adding numerous new features, improvements, and fixes, we've managed to reduce the bundle size by up to 16%, bringing the base bundle size down to just 35kB. This remarkable reduction was achieved through enhanced tree-shaking capabilities, modernized architecture, and careful optimization of core features.\n\nThis release introduces highly requested features like multi-pane support and new chart types. It also modernizes the codebase and improves its architecture to set a foundation for future enhancements without compromising on size.\n\nOne of our most requested features, multi-pane support is now available. It allows you to create complex chart layouts with multiple independent viewing areas. This enhancement enables sophisticated technical analysis setups and better visualization of related data series. Additional key benefits include:\n\nSee Panes for more information.\n\nSee Chart types for more information about the Yield Curve Chart and Options Chart types.\n\nWe've prepared a comprehensive migration guide to help you upgrade from v4 to v5. Key areas to note:\n\nSee the full migration guide: Migrating from v4 to v5\n\nThis release uses ES2020 syntax and no longer supports CommonJS. If you need to support older environments, you'll need to set up transpilation for the lightweight-charts package in your build system using tools like Babel.\n\nAs always, we thank you for your support and help in making Lightweight Charts™ the best product on the financial web. We look forward to seeing what you build with these new capabilities!\n\nYou can always send us your feedback via GitHub. Happy trading!\n\nSee changes since the last published version.\n\nChanges since the last published version.\n\nChanges since the last published version.\n\nChanges since the last published version.\n\nChanges since the last published version.\n\nChanges since the last published version.\n\nChanges since the last published version.\n\nChanges since the last published version.\n\nChanges since the last published version.\n\nChanges since the last published version.\n\nChanges since the last published version.\n\nChanges since the last published version.\n\nVersion 4.1 of Lightweight Charts introduces exciting new features, including the introduction of Plugins, which provide developers the ability to extend the library's functionality. Additionally, this release includes enhancements to customize the horizontal scale and various minor improvements and bug fixes.\n\nDevelopers can now leverage the power of Plugins in Lightweight Charts. Two types of Plugins are supported - Custom Series and Drawing Primitives, offering the ability to define new series types and create custom visualizations, drawing tools, and annotations.\n\nWith the flexibility provided by these plugins, developers can create highly customizable charting applications for their users.\n\nTo get started with plugins, please refer to our Plugins Documentation for a better understanding of what is possible and how plugins work. You can also explore our collection of plugin examples (with a preview hosted here) for inspiration and guidance on implementing specific functionality.\n\nTo help you get started quickly, we have created an NPM package called create-lwc-plugin, which sets up a plugin project for you. This way, you can hit the ground running with your plugin development.\n\nHorizontal Scale Customization\n\nThe horizontal scale is no longer restricted to only time-based values. The API has been extended to allow customization of the horizontal scale behavior, and enable uses cases like options chart where price values are displayed in the horizontal scale. The most common use-case would be to customise the tick marks behaviour.\n\nThe createChartEx function should be used instead of the usual createChart function, and an instance of a class implementing IHorzScaleBehavior should be provided.\n\nA simple example can be found in this test case: horizontal-price-scale.js\n\nThanks to our Contributors for this Release:\n\nYou can always send us your feedback via GitHub.

And as always, happy trading! Team TradingView\n\nSee issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version.\n\nWe're happy to announce the next release of Lightweight Charts™ library. This release includes many improvements and bug fixes (as usual), but we are thrilled to say that from this version the library has its own documentation website that replaces the documentation in the repository. Check it out and share your feedback in this discussion thread.\n\nThanks to our contributors:\n\nSee issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version.\n\nThanks to our contributors:\n\nSee issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version.\n\nSee changes since the last published version.\n\nOn this day 10 years ago, 10th September 2011, the very first version of the TradingView website was deployed. To celebrate 10th anniversary we're happy to announce the new version of lightweight-charts library v3.6.0 🎉🎉🎉\n\nThanks to our contributors:\n\nSee issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version.\n\nA note about rendering order of series, which might be interpret as a bug or breaking change since this release\n\nThis is not really a breaking change, but might be interpret like that. In #794 we've fixed the wrong order of series, thus now all series will be displayed in opposite order (they will be displayed in order of creating now; previously they were displayed in reversed order).\n\nTo fix that, just change the order of creating the series (thus instead of create series A, then series B create series B first and then series A) - see #812.\n\nThanks to our contributors:\n\nSee issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version.\n\nSee issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version.\n\nThanks to our contributors:\n\nSee issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version.\n\nThanks to our contributors:\n\nSee issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version.\n\nIt's a just re-published accidentally published 3.1.4 version, which didn't actually fix the issue #536.\n\nVersion 3.1.4 has been deprecated.\n\nSee issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version.\n\nSee issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version.\n\nSee issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version.\n\nSee issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version.\n\nUndocumented breaking changes\n\nWe know that some of users probably used some hacky-workarounds calling internal methods to achieve multi-pane support. In this release, to reduce size of the bundle we dropped out a code for pane's separator (which allows to resize panes).\n\nAs soon this workaround is undocumented and we don't support this feature yet - we don't bump a major version. But we think it's better to let you know that it has been changed.\n\nThanks to our contributors:\n\nSee issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version.\n\nSee issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version.\n\nWe have some breaking changes since the latest version due some features and API improvements:\n\nSee breaking changes doc with migration guide to migrate smoothly.\n\nThanks to our contributors:\n\nSee issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version.\n\nThanks to our contributors:\n\nSee issues assigned to this version’s milestone or changes since the last published version.\n\nSee issues assigned to this version’s milestone or changes since the last published version.\n\nThanks to our contributors:\n\nSee issues assigned to this version’s milestone or changes since the last published version.\n\nThe docs for this version are available here.",

      "description": "Release Notes5.1.0​ Version 5.1.0 introduces data conflation, a powerful performance optimization feature designed for charts with very large datasets. For most use cases with typical dataset sizes, this feature will operate transparently in the background. However, if you're working with datasets containing tens of thousands of data points or more, conflation can dramatically improve rendering performance when users zoom out. Major Updates in 5.1​ Data Conflation​ Data conflation is an automatic performance optimization that merges data points when zoomed out, significantly improving rendering performance for large datasets. When bar spacing falls below a threshold where multiple data points would be rendered in less than 0.5 pixels of screen space, the library intelligently combines them into single points. Key features: Opt-in activation: Conflation is disabled by default and can be enabled via the enableConflation option. Configurable options: Control conflation behavior through new time scale and series options: enableConflation - Enable or disable the feature (default: false). conflationThresholdFactor - Adjust the zoom level threshold for activation and create smoothing effects. Higher values (2.0, 4.0, 8.0+) result in smoother-looking charts, particularly useful for sparklines and small charts where smooth appearance is prioritized over showing every data point. precomputeConflationOnInit - Pre-calculate conflated data on initialization for improved zoom performance at the cost of initial load time and memory usage (default: false). precomputeConflationPriority - Control background computation priority when using the Prioritized Task Scheduling API (default: 'background'). Custom series support: Plugin developers can implement custom aggregation logic through the new CustomConflationReducer interface. This feature is particularly beneficial for applications displaying historical data spanning years or real-time feeds that accumulate large amounts of data over time. For typical use cases with moderate dataset sizes, conflation can remain disabled without any impact. (PR #1945) Enhancements Added doNotSnapToHiddenSeriesIndices option to CrosshairOptions. When enabled, the crosshair will snap to the nearest visible series data point instead of snapping to hidden series indices. (PR #1995) Bug Fixes Fixed price axis label positioning when using plugin views that don't implement the optional fixedCoordinate() method. Previously, labels were incorrectly treated as positioned at coordinate 0, causing false overlap detection. (PR #1993, fixes #1986, contributed by @tpunt) Fixed time scale fitContent method to properly respect the rightOffset option when rightOffsetPixels is not set. This addresses a regression introduced in version 5.0.9. (PR #1989, fixes #1988) Contributors We'd like to thank our external contributors for their valuable contributions to this release: @tpunt (Thomas Punt) Changes since the last published version. 5.0.9​ Enhancements Added rightOffsetPixels option to HorzScaleOptions, allowing margin space from the right side of the chart to be set in pixels. This option takes precedence over rightOffset and ensures consistent pixel offset when using fitContent on charts with different amounts of data. The pixel-based offset remains consistent during zoom operations. (PR #1957) Added pop method to series API that removes a specified number of data points from the end of the series and returns the removed data. (PR #1949, fixes #1518, contributed by @tpunt) Enhanced takeScreenshot method with two new optional parameters: addTopLayer - includes top layer primitives in the screenshot (default: false) includeCrosshair - includes the crosshair when addTopLayer is enabled (default: false) (PR #1977) Added autoScale option to SeriesMarkersOptions, allowing control over whether markers are included in the auto-scaling calculation of the price scale. When enabled (default: true), the chart will adjust its scale to ensure markers are fully visible. (PR #1940, contributed by @zbinlin) Added base option to price format configuration as an alternative to minMove. This helps avoid floating-point precision limitations when dealing with extremely small price movements. (PR #1952) Enhanced plugin API with additional functionality: Added lastValueData() method to the public series API Exposed setLineStyle drawing utility through a new DrawingUtils interface (PR #1956, contributed by @tpunt) Bug Fixes Fixed price scale visible range calculation when in logarithmic scale mode by properly converting the range from log space and handling precision issues with rounding. (PR #1965, contributed by @tpunt) Plugin & Indicator Examples Added Dual Range Histogram Series custom plugin example that visualizes paired positive and negative value ranges for each time point using a column-based display. (PR #1934) Added Pretty Histogram plugin example demonstrating non-standard histogram rendering. (PR #1930) Added examples demonstrating how to implement indicators (studies) within Lightweight Charts. See the Analysis Indicators tutorial for more information. (PR #1915) Contributors We'd like to thank our external contributors for their valuable contributions to this release: @tpunt (Thomas Punt) @zbinlin (Colin Cheng) Changes since the last published version. 5.0.8​ Enhancements Improved pane API with several new methods and options: Added addDefaultPane option to chart options, allowing creation of charts with no initial panes Added addPane method to IChartApi for programmatically adding panes Added setPreserveEmptyPane and preserveEmptyPane methods to control empty pane behavior Added getStretchFactor and setStretchFactor methods to control relative pane sizes Added addCustomSeries and addSeries methods to IPaneApi for creating series directly on a specific pane Updated getHTMLElement to return null when a pane hasn't been created yet These improvements provide greater flexibility when working with multi-pane charts (PR #1894, fixes #1898, #1896, #1872, #1907) Added additional price scale tick mark formatting capabilities: Added formatTickmarks method to IPriceFormatter interface Added tickmarksPriceFormatter and tickmarksPercentageFormatter options to LocalizationOptionsBase Added tickmarksFormatter option to PriceFormatCustom These new formatters provide all tick mark values at once, allowing for context-aware formatting decisions such as determining the optimal precision level needed (PR #1903) Changes since the last published version. 5.0.7​ Enhancements Added price scale visible range control with new methods in IPriceScaleApi: setVisibleRange(range), getVisibleRange(), and setAutoScale(on). These methods allow for programmatic control of the visible price range on a price scale. Also added ensureEdgeTickMarksVisible option to PriceScaleOptions, which ensures tick marks are always visible at the very top and bottom of the price scale, providing clear boundary indicators. These features are particularly useful for charts with zooming and panning disabled that are primarily for display purposes. (PR #1856) Added control over the rendering stacking order of series markers through a new zOrder option in the series markers plugin. This enhancement provides greater flexibility in controlling marker visibility and layering in complex charts. (PR #1876). Changes since the last published version. 5.0.6​ Enhancements Implemented series order functionality, allowing control over the rendering order of series within a pane. Series with higher order values are rendered on top of those with lower values. Added two new methods to ISeriesApi: seriesOrder() to get the current order index and setSeriesOrder(order) to set a specific order. (PR #1868) Changes since the last published version. 5.0.5​ Bug Fixes Fixed an issue where the series marker plugin could throw an exception if the series data required for individual markers could not be found (such as when the data is cleared or changed via ⁠setData on the series). (PR #1845) Changes since the last published version. 5.0.4​ Improvements Fixed performance degradation when adding series markers to charts with large datasets (15,000+ data points) by optimizing marker calculations to only run when necessary. (PR #1835, fixes #1808) Added price-based positioning for series markers, allowing more precise control over marker placement. New position types include atPriceTop, atPriceBottom, and atPriceMiddle, which require a price value to be specified. (PR #1826, thanks to @EranGrin) Added MagnetOHLC to CrosshairMode. This mode sticks the crosshair's horizontal line to the price value of a single-value series or to the open/high/low/close price of OHLC-based series. (PR #1831, thanks to @Jonney) Bug Fixes Fixed an issue where the crosshair marker would be visible on the first data point when the chart is initially loaded, before any user interaction. This behavior has been reverted to match version 4, where the crosshair remains hidden until user interaction. (PR #1840) Changes since the last published version. 5.0.3​ Bug Fixes Fixed an issue where changing the price scale for one pane would impact all panes in multi-pane setups. Added pane index parameter to the price scale API to ensure changes only affect the intended pane. (PR #1821, fixes #1817) Fixed an issue where a cursorStyle defined in a primitive hit-test wouldn't be applied. Additionally improved cursor style handling to maintain the correct cursor when the mouse remains in the same position while price/time scales are adjusted. (PR #1823) Changes since the last published version. 5.0.2​ Bug Fixes Fixed an issue where the crosshair marker would remain visible after the mouse pointer has left the chart. (PR #1807) Changes since the last published version. 5.0.0​ Version 5.0.0 represents a significant milestone in the evolution of Lightweight Charts™, delivering on our commitment to keep the library truly \"lightweight\". Despite adding numerous new features, improvements, and fixes, we've managed to reduce the bundle size by up to 16%, bringing the base bundle size down to just 35kB. This remarkable reduction was achieved through enhanced tree-shaking capabilities, modernized architecture, and careful optimization of core features. This release introduces highly requested features like multi-pane support and new chart types. It also modernizes the codebase and improves its architecture to set a foundation for future enhancements without compromising on size. Major Updates in 5.0​ Multi-Pane Support​ One of our most requested features, multi-pane support is now available. It allows you to create complex chart layouts with multiple independent viewing areas. This enhancement enables sophisticated technical analysis setups and better visualization of related data series. Additional key benefits include: Full support for multiple panes within a single chart Independent scale and series management per pane Flexible pane sizing and arrangement options See Panes for more information. New Chart Types​ Yield Curve Charts New specialized chart type for displaying yield curves Custom horizontal scale behavior with linear spacing Optimized whitespace handling Options Charts Price-based horizontal scale support Specialized formatting and interaction handling Ideal for options chain visualization See Chart types for more information about the Yield Curve Chart and Options Chart types. Enhanced Color Support​ Expanded native support for sRGB-based colors (RGB, RGBA, hex, named colors, HSL) Support for expanded color gamuts like Display P3 Ability to specify a custom color parser to add support for non-sRGB formats Reduced bundle size through browser-native color parsing Architectural Improvements​ Watermark feature reimplemented as plugins (TextWatermark and ImageWatermark) Series Markers extracted as a plugin for better tree-shaking New Up/Down Markers Plugin for price change visualization Introduction of Pane Primitives for plugin attachment Breaking Changes​ New unified series creation API (see migration guide) Dropped CommonJS support and updated JS syntax version to ES2020 Watermark functionality moved to plugins Series markers implementation changed to plugin system Enhancements​ Added relative gradient option for baseline and area series (relativeGradient) New time scale option for maximum bar spacing (maxBarSpacing) Added priceLines() method to ISeriesApi interface Enhanced watermark capabilities with multi-line text support Improved plugin system with Pane Primitives support Better tree-shaking capabilities for smaller bundle sizes Bug Fixes​ Fixed primitive detachment update issues (#1594) Various performance and rendering improvements Migration Guide​ We've prepared a comprehensive migration guide to help you upgrade from v4 to v5. Key areas to note: Series Creation API changes Watermarks and Series Markers moving to separate plugins Plugin system updates See the full migration guide: Migrating from v4 to v5 Technical Notes​ This release uses ES2020 syntax and no longer supports CommonJS. If you need to support older environments, you'll need to set up transpilation for the lightweight-charts package in your build system using tools like Babel. As always, we thank you for your support and help in making Lightweight Charts™ the best product on the financial web. We look forward to seeing what you build with these new capabilities! You can always send us your feedback via GitHub. Happy trading! Team TradingView See changes since the last published version. 4.2.3​ Minor Improvements Improve check for crosshair label visibility on the price scale. This improves upon previous work (#1743 in v4.2.2) by reducing the allocated space for the crosshair when it is enabled, but the label is disabled. (PR #1757) Bug Fixes Added additional prototype pollution protection for internal merge helper function. (PR #1758) Changes since the last published version. 4.2.2​ Minor Improvements Improved price scale width calculation by not allocating space for crosshair labels when the crosshair is disabled. (PR #1743) Bug Fixes Fixed calculations for fixLeftEdge and fixRightEdge on the first render when both are true and data is added to an initially empty chart. Fixes issue #1356. (PR #1741) Changes since the last published version. 4.2.1​ Bug Fixes Fixed an issue where the series title part of a price scale label appeared blurry when using Firefox. Changes since the last published version. 4.2.0​ Enhancements Added new attributionLogo option to LayoutOptions. This feature displays the TradingView attribution logo on the main chart pane by default, helping users meet the library's licensing requirements for attribution. The TradingView attribution logo can be easily hidden by setting the attributionLogo option to false in the chart's layout option. Improved data validation for OhlcData and SingleValueData. Introduced isFulfilledBarData for OhlcData and isFulfilledLineData for SingleValueData, ensuring more accurate validation of data types. Contributed by @mozeryansky (PR #1579, fixes #1526). Changes since the last published version. 4.1.7​ Enhancements Further Refinement of the Price Scale Label Alignment (PR #1630) Changes since the last published version. 4.1.6​ Enhancements Improved Price Scale Label Alignment: Enhanced the alignment algorithm for price scale labels to ensure they do not move out of the viewport. This improves the visibility of price labels, particularly when they are near the edges of the scale. Fixes #1620 (PR #1621) Changes since the last published version. 4.1.5​ Enhancements Added IHorzScaleBehavior.shouldResetTickmarkLabels. (PR #1614) Changes since the last published version. 4.1.4​ Bug Fixes Fixed hoveredSeries being undefined during series removal and creation. (PR #1529, fixes #1406, fixes #1499) Fixed price label rendering artefact.

(PR #1510) Bug Fixes Fixed sub-pixel horizontal alignment of the crosshair marker and series markers. (PR #1505, fixes #1504) Changes since the last published version. 4.1.2​ Bug Fixes Fix for 'Total canvas memory use exceeds the maximum limit' error raised on iOS Safari. (PR #1485) Minor Improvements Improved error messages for price scale margins. (PR #1489) Changes since the last published version. 4.1.1​ Bug Fixes Fixed shiftVisibleRangeOnNewBar behaviour for realtime updates to a series. Additionally, a new option allowShiftVisibleRangeOnWhitespaceReplacement has been added if you wish to have the old 4.0 behaviour for when new data replaces existing whitespace. (PR #1444) When disabling touch scrolling on the chart via either the vertTouchDrag or horzTouchDrag setting in the handleScroll options, any touch scroll events over the corresponding scale will now be ignored so the page can be scrolled. (PR #1445) Changes since the last published version. 4.1.0​ Version 4.1 of Lightweight Charts introduces exciting new features, including the introduction of Plugins, which provide developers the ability to extend the library's functionality. Additionally, this release includes enhancements to customize the horizontal scale and various minor improvements and bug fixes. Major Updates Plugins Developers can now leverage the power of Plugins in Lightweight Charts. Two types of Plugins are supported - Custom Series and Drawing Primitives, offering the ability to define new series types and create custom visualizations, drawing tools, and annotations. With the flexibility provided by these plugins, developers can create highly customizable charting applications for their users. To get started with plugins, please refer to our Plugins Documentation for a better understanding of what is possible and how plugins work. You can also explore our collection of plugin examples (with a preview hosted here) for inspiration and guidance on implementing specific functionality. To help you get started quickly, we have created an NPM package called create-lwc-plugin, which sets up a plugin project for you. This way, you can hit the ground running with your plugin development. Horizontal Scale Customization The horizontal scale is no longer restricted to only time-based values. The API has been extended to allow customization of the horizontal scale behavior, and enable uses cases like options chart where price values are displayed in the horizontal scale. The most common use-case would be to customise the tick marks behaviour. The createChartEx function should be used instead of the usual createChart function, and an instance of a class implementing IHorzScaleBehavior should be provided. A simple example can be found in this test case: horizontal-price-scale.js Enhancements Added point markers styling option for line-based series. (closes #365) Docs Added double click subscriber for the main chart pane. (closes #1385) Docs Added setCrosshairPosition API, allowing programmatic setting of the crosshair position. (fixes #1198, #1163, #438) Docs Added an option to disable crosshair. Introduced the Hidden option in the CrosshairMode setting. (closes #749, thanks to @luk707) Allow overriding tick mark label length via the tickMarkMaxCharacterLength option. (closes #1396) Docs Support for overriding the percentage formatter within the localization options. (fixes #1328, #1291) Docs Added paneSize getter to IChartApi, returning the dimensions of the chart pane. (issue #1411) Docs Added options to set minimum dimensions for the price and time scales. (closes #1062, related to #1163, #50) Docs, Docs Bug Fixes Fixed chart layout when direction is set to RTL. (PR #1338) Fixed re-enabling of autoSize after disabling it. (PR #1274) Corrected percentage mode and zero first value. (fixes #1386) Prevent chart shifting when new data replaces existing whitespace. (fixes #1201) Thanks to our Contributors for this Release: @luk707 You can always send us your feedback via GitHub. We look forward to hearing from you! And as always, happy trading! Team TradingView See issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version. 4.0.1​ Enhancements Add the ability to specify font colour for the Priceline labels. #1274 #1287 Ignore resize method if autoSize is active, and added API to check if active. #1301 Bug fixes Typo in customization guide.

In #794 we've fixed the wrong order of series, thus now all series will be displayed in opposite order (they will be displayed in order of creating now; previously they were displayed in reversed order). To fix that, just change the order of creating the series (thus instead of create series A, then series B create series B first and then series A) - see #812. Fixed Screenshot output missing piece on bottom right (see #798) Overlapped line chart show wrong color order when hover (see #794) Price line label show on both axis (see #795) Thanks to our contributors: @thanhlmm Thanh Le See issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version. 3.4.0​ Enhancement Add option to fix right edge (see #218) Drop restriction for min bar spacing value (see #558) Round corners of the line-style plots (see #731) Fixed AutoscaleProvider documentation error (see #773) Candlestick upColor and downColor is not changed on applyOptions (see #750) Cleared and reset data appears at visually different location (see #757) Remove unused internal method from SeriesApi (see #768) Removing data for the last series doesn't actually remove the data (see #752) to date of getVisibleRange contains partially visible data item and it's impossible to hover it (see #624) series.priceFormatter().format(price) does not work (see #790) See issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version. 3.3.0​ Enhancement Add type predicates for series type (see #670) Create Grid instance for every pane (see #382) Add possibility to chose crosshairMarker color, so it will be independent from line-series color (see #310) Implement option not to shift the time scale at all when data is added with setData (see #584) Fixed Incorrect bar height when its value is more than chart's height (see #673) Disabling autoScale for non-visible series (see #687) Thanks to our contributors: @dubroff @SuperPenguin Andree Yosua @mecm1993 Manuel Cepeda See issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version. 3.2.0​ Enhancement Feat/gzip friendly colors (see #598) Add coordinateToLogical and logicalToCoordinate (see #587) Add API to show/hide series without removing it (see #471) Add run-time validation of inputs in debug mode (see #315) Pixel perfect renderers fixes (see #535) Add title option to createPriceLine (see #357) Fixed Set rightOffset and scrollToPosition async as well as setVisibleRange (see #406) timeScale() changes visible range on setData() (see #549) Remove chart's size restriction or make it smaller (see #366) LineStyle.Dotted make no effect (see #572) If priceScaleId is empty string, invalid price scale api is returned (see #537) Incorrect Selection seen on long press in ios webview on chart (see #609) One-point line series is invisible (see #597) Empty price scale after creating series with the same price range (see #615) Infra and dev env Compress artifacts in graphics tests in CI (see #145) Run tests against production build (see #503) Add test to check code usage coverage (see #495) Migrate from codechecks (see #356) Updated dev deps Thanks to our contributors: Andree Yosua @SuperPenguin Christos @christose Shergin Rodion @beholderrk wenhoujx @wenhoujx See issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version. 3.1.5​ It's a just re-published accidentally published 3.1.4 version, which didn't actually fix the issue #536. Version 3.1.4 has been deprecated. Fixed TypeError _internal_priceScale is not a function while getting series price scale (see #536) See issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version. 3.1.3​ Fixed handleScroll and handleScale options aren't applied (see #527) See issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version. 3.1.2​ Fixed Crosshair doesn't work on touch devices (see #511) See issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version. 3.1.1​ Fixed Fixed production build of 3.1 version (see #502 and 62aa93724e40fbb1b678d9b44655279a1df529c5) See issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version. 3.1.0​ Enhancement Whitespaces support (see #209) Custom font families for watermarks (see #437) Fixed Added support for 'transparent' color (see #491) Refactor DataLayer/ChartApi (see #270) Remove series then scroll to right after not working (see #355) Scaling via mouse click and drag doesn't work if chart is inside shadow root (see #427) Applying watermark in setTimeout doesn't make an effect (see #485) Importing the library in server-side context caused ReferenceError (see #446) Undocumented breaking changes We know that some of users probably used some hacky-workarounds calling internal methods to achieve multi-pane support. In this release, to reduce size of the bundle we dropped out a code for pane's separator (which allows to resize panes). As soon this workaround is undocumented and we don't support this feature yet - we don't bump a major version. But we think it's better to let you know that it has been changed. Development Dropped support NodeJS < 12.18 Migrated from TSLint to ESLint (see #314) Migrated from clean-publish to in-house script to clear package.json (see #474) Thanks to our contributors: Meet Mangukiya @meetmangukiya NekitCorp @NekitCorp See issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version. 3.0.1​ Fixed Correctly handle overlay: true in series options while create series to backward compat (see #475) See issues assigned to this version's milestone or changes since the last published version. 3.0.0​ Breaking changes We have some breaking changes since the latest version due some features and API improvements: Methods subscribeVisibleTimeRangeChange and unsubscribeVisibleTimeRangeChange has been moved from ChartApi to TimeScaleApi Since 3.0 you can specify price axis you'd like to place the series on.
