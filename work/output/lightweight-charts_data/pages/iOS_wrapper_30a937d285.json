This will be updated to v4.0.0 in the near future.\n\nYou can use Lightweight Charts™ inside an iOS application. To use Lightweight Charts™ in that context, you can use our iOS wrapper, which will allow you to interact with Lightweight Charts™ library, which will be rendered in a web view.\n\nCocoaPods is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate LightweightCharts into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:\n\nThe Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler.\n\nOnce you have your Swift package set up, adding LightweightCharts as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.\n\nOnce the library has been installed in your repo, you're ready to create your first chart.\n\nFirst of all, in a file where you would like to create a chart, you need to import the library:\n\nCreate instance of LightweightCharts, which is a subclass of UIView, and add it to your view.\n\nAdd any series to the chart and store a reference to it.\n\nAdd data to the series.\n\nThe GitHub repository for LightweightChartsIOS contains an example of the library in action. To run the example, start by cloning the repository, go to the Example directory, and then run",
